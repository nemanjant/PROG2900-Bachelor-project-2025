## Project Overview

This repository contains all data, scripts, and code associated with bachelor thesis titled *"Cursor Dynamics for Deception Detection"*. The study explores whether deceptive intent can be detected from subtle variations in mouse movement behavior during binary question answering. Two modeling approaches were investigated: a classical machine learning pipeline using Random Forest, and a deep learning architecture combining LSTM, GRU, and attention mechanisms.

A total of 700 mouse movement samples were collected in a controlled experiment. Each sample was labeled as either **truthful** or **deceitful**, and analyzed using dynamic features such as velocity, acceleration, jerk, curvature, hesitation, pauses, and total movement time.

## Repository Structure

The Repository Structure section outlines the organization of all project files, including scripts for classical and deep learning models, raw mouse movement data, visualization tools, and the web-based data collection system.

```

## Installation

### 1. Clone repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/nemanjant/PROG2900-Bachelor-project-2025.git
cd PROG2900-Bachelor-project-2025
```

### 2. Install dependencies:
Ensure you have Node.js and Python 3.11 installed. Then, run:
```
npm install
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Collecting Data (Optional)

Run the Node.js backend. The backend saves mouse data to JSON files locally during the experiment. After collection, data needs to be sorted in two folders data/truthful and data/deceitful. Samples needs to be labeled.
```
node server.js
```
