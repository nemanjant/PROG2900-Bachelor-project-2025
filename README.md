## Project Overview

This repository contains all data, scripts, and code associated with bachelor thesis titled *"Cursor Dynamics for Deception Detection"*. The study explores whether deceptive intent can be detected from subtle variations in mouse movement behavior during binary question answering. Two modeling approaches were investigated: a classical machine learning pipeline using Random Forest, and a deep learning architecture combining LSTM, GRU, and attention mechanisms.

A total of 700 mouse movement samples were collected in a controlled experiment. Each sample was labeled as either **truthful** or **deceitful**, and analyzed using dynamic features such as velocity, acceleration, jerk, curvature, hesitation, pauses, and total movement time.

## Repository Structure

The Repository Structure section outlines the organization of all project files, including scripts for classical and deep learning models, raw mouse movement data, visualization tools, and the web-based data collection system.
