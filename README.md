## Project Overview

This repository contains all data, scripts, and code associated with bachelor thesis titled *"Cursor Dynamics for Deception Detection"*. The study explores whether deceptive intent can be detected from subtle variations in mouse movement behavior during binary question answering. Two modeling approaches were investigated: a classical machine learning pipeline using Random Forest, and a deep learning architecture combining LSTM, GRU, and attention mechanisms.

A total of 700 mouse movement samples were collected in a controlled experiment. Each sample was labeled as either **truthful** or **deceitful**, and analyzed using dynamic features such as velocity, acceleration, jerk, curvature, hesitation, pauses, and total movement time.

## Repository Structure

The Repository Structure section outlines the organization of all project files, including scripts for classical and deep learning models, raw mouse movement data, visualization tools, and the web-based data collection system.

```

## Installation

### 1. Clone repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/nemanjant/PROG2900-Bachelor-project-2025.git
cd PROG2900-Bachelor-project-2025
```

### 2. Install dependencies:
Ensure you have Node.js and Python 3.11 installed. Then, run:
```
npm install
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage Instructions

### Collecting Data (Optional)

Run the Node.js backend. 
```
node server.js
```
The backend saves mouse data to JSON files locally during the experiment. After collection, data needs to be sorted in two folders data/truthful and data/deceitful. Samples needs to be labeled.

### Collected Data Analysis

This section explains how to generate visualizations and statistical summaries from collected data. All scripts below are located in `data_analysys_stats/utils/`. Before running them, ensure you have installed all required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`.

**1. Generate Summary Statistics**

Extract key behavioral metrics (e.g., hesitation, pause count, jerk spikes):
```
python data_analysys_stats/utils/average_mouse_stats.py
```
This will produce `truthful_mouse_stats_summary.json` and `deceitful_mouse_stats_summary.json` loocated in: `data_analysys_stats/averaged_data/`.

**2. Interpolate Average Movement Trajectories**

Smooth and interpolate mean cursor paths for both classes:
```
python data_analysys_stats/utils/average_mouse_pattern_graphs.py
```
This generates `truthful_averaged_result_interpolated.json ` and  `deceitful_averaged_result_interpolated.json `.

**3. Plot Average Movement Feature Charts**

Compare high-level movement statistics across classes:
```
python data_analysys_stats/utils/average_mouse_stats_chart.py
```

**4. Plot Acceleration, Curvature, and Jerk Time-Series**

For detailed temporal comparisons between truthful and deceitful responses:
```
python data_analysys_stats/utils/acj_plot_graphs.py
python data_analysys_stats/utils/acj_interpolation_plot.py
```

**5. Plot Jerk Spike Patterns**
   
Visualize frequency and intensity of motor conflict events (jerk):
```
python data_analysys_stats/utils/jspk_plot_graphs.py
```

**6. Label Training Samples**

Add class labels (0 = truthful, 1 = deceitful) to JSON samples for model training:
```
python data_analysys_stats/utils/labeling_data_training.py
```

All generated visualizations are automatically saved to `data_analysys_stats/graph_charts/`.

Make sure to verify the paths and JSON structure before running the scripts. These plots support both analysis and illustration of behavioral differences between truthful and deceitful responses.

### Model Training

This section describes how to train the classical Random Forest model and the deep learning LSTM-GRU-Attention model using the scripts provided in the `classical_model_training/` and `deep_learning_model_training/` directories.

**Classical Machine Learning (Random Forest)**

**1. Train/Test Split â€“ Baseline Random Forest**

Run the following script to train and evaluate a basic Random Forest model on an 80/20 data split:
```
python classical_model_training/model_training_rf_v2.py
```
Outputs are performance metrics printed in terminal and saved confusion matrix and feature importance plots.

**2. Stratified 5-Fold Cross-Validation**

Use this script to evaluate model robustness across 5 folds:
```
python classical_model_training/model_training_rf_cv_fold.py
```
Output is fold-wise accuracy, recall and  macro F1-score.

All visualisations of classical model training are saved in `classical_model_training/classical_graph/`.
