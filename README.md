## Abstract

This project looks at whether you can spot when someoneâ€™s lying by tracking tiny changes in their mouse movements while they answer yes/no questions. We built and tested two kinds of modelsâ€”a Random Forest using hand-picked features and a combined LSTM-GRU network with attentionâ€”to see which one works better.

## Background

This repository hosts all code and data for the bachelor thesis *"Cursor Dynamics for Deception Detection"*. The study explores whether deceptive intent can be detected from mouse movement behavior, comparing a classical machine learning approach with a deep learning architecture.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nemanjant/PROG2900-Bachelor-project-2025.git
cd PROG2900-Bachelor-project-2025
```

### 2. Install dependencies
Make sure you have Python 3.11 and Node.js installed:
```bash
npm install
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
---

## Usage

### 1. Data Collection
To run the local web experiment:
```bash
node server.js
```
Mouse movement responses will be saved as structured JSON files. After collection, sort files into `data/truthful/` and `data/deceitful/`.

### 2. Data Analysis
Use the scripts in `data_analysys_stats/utils/` to process and visualize data:
```bash
# Generate summary statistics
python average_mouse_stats.py

# Interpolate average cursor paths
python average_mouse_pattern_graphs.py

# Plot behavioral features
python average_mouse_stats_chart.py
python acj_plot_graphs.py
python acj_interpolation_plot.py
python jspk_plot_graphs.py

# Add class labels for modeling
python labeling_data_training.py
```
Outputs are saved in `data_analysys_stats/averaged_data/` and `graph_charts/`.


### 3. Model Training

#### Classical Model (Random Forest)
- **Baseline (80/20 split):**
```bash
python classical_model_training/model_training_rf_v1.py
```

- **5-Fold Cross-Validation:**
```bash
python classical_model_training/model_training_rf_cv_fold.py
```

#### Deep Learning Model (LSTM-GRU-Attention)
```bash
python deep_learning_model_training/model_training_lstm_gru_v2.py
```
Models are saved as `.h5` files with corresponding logs per fold.

## Data

The dataset includes 700 samples (350 truthful, 350 deceitful) collected from 35 participants. Each JSON file captures cursor movements, timestamps, and derived behavioral features:

- **Trajectory:** `mouseMovements`, `timestamps`, `velocity`, `acceleration`, `jerk`, `curvature`
- **Behavioral:** `pausePoints`, `hesitation`, `hesitationLevel`, `totalTime`, `averageSpeed`
- **Metadata:** `question`, `answer`, `label` (`0` = truthful, `1` = deceitful)

## Methodology

Participants answered yes/no questions truthfully and deceitfully in a browser-based experiment. Mouse dynamics were recorded in real time using JavaScript and saved as JSON via a Node.js backend. Raw (x, y) cursor paths were processed into standardized feature sets including movement derivatives and behavioral summaries. Models were trained using stratified 5-fold cross-validation.<br />

### 3. Evaluation
Evaluation included accuracy, recall, macro F1-score, ROC/AUC, matrix correlations and feature importance.<br />

## Project Workflow

  <img src="extra_img/project_flow.png" alt="Data Flow" width="90%" />
</p>

This diagram illustrates the end-to-end workflow of the project, starting from data collection and recording, through preprocessing and feature extraction, branching into both classical (Random Forest) and deep learning (LSTM-GRU-Attention) training pipelines, and culminating in a final comparative evaluation of model performance.

The diagram summarizes data collection, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

## Results & Evaluation

### Collected Data Insights

- **Trajectory Patterns:** Truthful mouse paths tended to be smoother and more direct, whereas deceptive responses showed greater curvature and spatial deviation.  
- **Timing & Speed:** On average, truthful trials took 2.48 s vs. 2.07 s for deceptive ones; deceptive movements were slightly faster (377.7 px/s vs. 355.7 px/s).  
- **Variability & Jerk:** Deceptive trials produced more jerk spikes (â‰ˆ12 vs. â‰ˆ6) and exhibited larger acceleration fluctuations, suggesting more abrupt motion adjustments.

### Model Performance Summary

| Model                                    | Accuracy | Macro F1 | AUC  |
|------------------------------------------|----------|----------|------|
| **Random Forest (Baseline)**             | 58.6 %   | 0.58     | 0.60 |
| **Random Forest (5-Fold Average)**       | 57.7 %   | 0.576    | 0.62 |
| **LSTMâ€“GRUâ€“Attention (5-Fold Average)**  | 54.4 %   | 0.55     | 0.57 |
| **LSTMâ€“GRUâ€“Attention (Best Fold)**       | 62.1 %   | 0.62     | 0.65 |

- The Random Forest baseline achieves 58.6 % accuracy; across 5-fold CV it averaged 57.7 % accuracy, 0.576 macro F1, and 0.62 AUC.  
- The LSTMâ€“GRUâ€“Attention model averaged 54.4 % accuracy, 0.55 macro F1, and 0.57 AUC across folds; its best fold reached 62.1 % accuracy, 0.62 macro F1, and 0.65 AUC.  
- A paired t-test on the five macro F1 scores (p = 0.462) indicates no statistically significant difference in overall performance.
